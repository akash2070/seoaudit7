# SEO Audit Pro - Deployment Options

## Option 1: Single Cloud Service (Easier)

### Railway (Full-Stack) - Recommended
```bash
# Deploy entire project together
git push origin main
# Railway automatically runs: npm run build && node server/railway-server.js
```

**Pros:**
- One deployment, one domain
- Simpler setup
- No CORS issues
- One environment to manage

**Environment Variables:**
```
GOOGLE_PAGESPEED_API_KEY=your_key_here
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
```

## Option 2: Separate Cloud Services (More Scalable)

### Frontend: Vercel
```bash
# Deploy client folder only
cd client
npm run build
# Deploy dist folder to Vercel
```

### Backend: Railway/Heroku/Render
```bash
# Deploy entire project, but serves API only
# Uses server/railway-server.js
```

**Frontend Environment (.env):**
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app
```

**Backend Environment:**
```
GOOGLE_PAGESPEED_API_KEY=your_key_here
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
```

**Pros:**
- Better performance (CDN for frontend)
- Independent scaling
- Specialized services

**Cons:**
- More complex setup
- CORS configuration needed
- Two deployments to manage

## Current Configuration

Your project supports BOTH options:

✅ **Ready for Single Service**: 
- `server/railway-server.js` serves both API and static files
- Railway config in `railway.toml`

✅ **Ready for Separate Services**:
- Frontend can read `VITE_API_BASE_URL` for backend URL
- Standalone backend server with CORS support
- Vercel config in `vercel.json`

## Recommendation

**Start with Railway (Option 1)** for simplicity, then migrate to separate services later if needed for scaling.
