# Railway Deployment - Issue Fixed

## Problem Solved
The Railway deployment was failing due to ES modules compatibility issues. The error occurred because:
- `package.json` has `"type": "module"` 
- Railway was trying to run `railway-server.js` with CommonJS syntax
- Node.js treated it as ES module and threw `require is not defined` error

## Solution Implemented
Created `railway-deploy.cjs` with proper CommonJS syntax to avoid ES module conflicts.

## Files for Railway Deployment

1. **Main Deployment File**: `railway-deploy.cjs`
   - Pure CommonJS syntax 
   - Complete SEO audit functionality
   - Health check endpoints at `/health` and `/api/health`
   - All API endpoints: `/api/audit`, `/api/speed`, `/api/meta`, `/api/links`, `/api/robots`, `/api/headers`

2. **Configuration**: `railway.toml`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Start command: `node railway-deploy.cjs`
   - Health check: `/health`

3. **Environment Variables Required**:
   ```
   GOOGLE_PAGESPEED_API_KEY=AIzaSyDwyq91FrL3fka6PFNzkhvU621ppf5ZliU
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=5000
   ```

## Deployment Steps
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Connect Railway to your GitHub repo
3. Set environment variables in Railway dashboard
4. Deploy - Railway will automatically use the configuration

## Health Check Confirmed
The deployment includes proper health check endpoints that Railway monitoring will use to verify service status.

## Result
Railway deployment should now work without ES module compatibility errors.
