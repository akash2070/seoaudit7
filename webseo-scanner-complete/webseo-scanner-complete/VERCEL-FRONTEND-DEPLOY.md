# Vercel Frontend Deployment - Fixed

## Issue Resolved
Vercel was showing a blank page because the frontend lacked proper build configuration.

## Fixed Files Created:
- `client/package.json` - Frontend dependencies and build scripts
- `client/vite.config.ts` - Vite build configuration 
- `client/tailwind.config.ts` - Tailwind CSS config
- `client/postcss.config.js` - PostCSS config
- `client/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript config

## Deployment Steps:

### Option 1: Deploy Client Folder Only
1. In Vercel dashboard, select "Import Git Repository"
2. Choose your GitHub repo
3. Set **Root Directory** to `client`
4. Vercel will auto-detect Vite framework
5. Deploy

### Option 2: Deploy Full Repo with Config
1. Use the `vercel.json` configuration (already configured)
2. Set environment variable: `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-railway-backend.up.railway.app`
3. Deploy entire repository

## Environment Variables for Vercel:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://seo-audit-production.up.railway.app
```

## Backend Connection:
The frontend will connect to your Railway backend API. Make sure:
1. Railway backend is deployed and running
2. CORS is enabled (already configured in `railway-deploy.cjs`)
3. Environment variable points to correct Railway URL

The blank page issue should now be resolved with proper frontend build configuration.
